## 2025-01-16 - DoS Prevention via Input Truncation
**Vulnerability:** The application was vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) and memory exhaustion attacks because it read entire files (PDF/EPUB) into memory without any length limits. It also accepted unlimited text input into the state store.
**Learning:** Client-side applications are not immune to DoS. Loading a 1GB text file into a string variable can crash the browser tab, leading to poor UX and potential loss of unsaved work. Security in client-side apps often aligns with performance and stability.
**Prevention:** Implemented a centralized `MAX_INPUT_LENGTH` (5MB) and a `sanitizeInput` utility. Applied this limit during file parsing (truncating early) and when setting input text in the store. This ensures the application remains responsive even with malicious or accidental large inputs.
